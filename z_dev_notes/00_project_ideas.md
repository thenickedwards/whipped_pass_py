# Brainstorming Password Helper Project

- **Password Py - Passwords as Easy as Pie 🥧** <br>
  This tool but could assist with suggesting strong passwords for a user. The user could submit a word or short phrase and the application would convert a few of the characters to create a "root" password and then also suggest (or use user input) to add characters specific to the login around the root of the password.
